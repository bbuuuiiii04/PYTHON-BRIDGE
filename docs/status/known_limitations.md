# Known Limitations

## Compatibility limitations

- Rekordbox version support is not broadly validated.
- OS support is macOS-local only in current evidence.
- Windows and Linux are not current supported targets.
- SoundSwitch version/interface compatibility is not broadly documented.
- Laser support depends on local MIDI mapping and fixture behavior.
- Govee support is not generalized across devices.

## Runtime limitations

- Direct Rekordbox readers depend on app memory layout, permissions, offsets, and platform behavior.
- Local config and secrets are intentionally not committed.
- Hardware behavior can drift from software tests.
- Old docs and prompts may describe plans that are already stale.

## Documentation limitations

- Existing docs before this refactor may overuse “current authoritative.”
- Historical docs are useful evidence, not truth.
- Any doc without a status header or inventory entry should be treated cautiously.
